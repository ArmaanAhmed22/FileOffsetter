## The "FileOffsetter" Tool
This is the beginning of a versatile tool that can be used to offset regions - for now numbers - of files' names.

Do:
	./offset.py -h
to get started and learn how to use it!

**NOTE**: This tool is not <em>yet</em> completed. For the Regex generalization, you can't use wildcards or unknown quantifiers (e.g. '+').
